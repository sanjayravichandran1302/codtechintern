During my internship, I completed four major Java-based projects that demonstrate core programming, networking, and basic AI concepts.

The first task was developing a File Handling Utility in Java. This application performs file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files using Java I/O classes like File, FileWriter, and Scanner. The program allows users to input text, store it in a file, retrieve file content, and replace specific words dynamically. Exception handling is implemented to manage errors such as missing files or input/output failures. This task strengthened my understanding of data persistence, string manipulation, and file stream operations in Java.

The second task involved building a REST API Client. In this project, I created a Java application that sends HTTP GET requests to a public API and processes JSON responses. Using Java’s HttpClient, the program connects to an external web service, retrieves real-time data, and displays it in a structured format. This task demonstrated how Java applications interact with web services, handle HTTP communication, and parse JSON data. It enhanced my knowledge of networking concepts and real-world API integration.

The third task was implementing a Multithreaded Client-Server Chat Application using Java Sockets. The server uses ServerSocket to accept multiple client connections, and each client runs in a separate thread to enable simultaneous communication. Messages sent by one client are broadcast to all connected users in real time. This project helped me understand socket programming, multithreading, concurrency control, and real-time communication systems.

The final task was developing an AI-Based Recommendation System using collaborative filtering concepts. The system analyzes user ratings and identifies similar users based on shared preferences. It then recommends new products to a target user based on similarity calculations. The implementation uses Java collections to store and process user-item data. This project introduced me to basic artificial intelligence concepts such as recommendation logic, data analysis, and personalization techniques commonly used in e-commerce and content platforms.

Together, these projects enhanced my practical skills in Java programming, networking, multithreading, API integration, and foundational AI concepts.
